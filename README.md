## NOTE:
### FGKF-601
This device has no wake up interval. After changing settings, wake up the device manually (by using the exclusion button press sequence) to store them on the device.

### FGS-2xx Devices:
Main Device = Also Relay/Switch 1 (S1/Q1)
Relay/Switch 2 = Relay/Switch 2 (S2/Q2)

### FGS-223:
Scene cards only triggers with the "Main Node" as device.
The "Right Switch (S2)" as device doesn't work.

### FGPB-101:
When the app has just started, it can take up to 2 minutes before it reacts.
If it takes longer you (probably) need to restart your homey.
